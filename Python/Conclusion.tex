\section{Conclusion}

As explained before, Python is a perfect language to easily build various type of applications. 
Reflection seems to be omnipresent in this language. 
It is completely integrated in the way of programming in Python.
Using reflection is done naturally and most of the people do it without even knowing the concept of reflection. 
This is for us the proof that reflection is successfully and fully integrated in Python.
Other languages can learn a lot from Python because we can do nearly everything in simplicity.
However, we found a little weakness: we can not manipulate basic classes such as int or basestring although we can in Ruby.
This is not a big deal because if we really need to do such a manipulation we could create a custom class that has the same behaviour than one of these classes and we could manipulate it.
There is always a solution, even if it is sometimes much more complex than it is in other languages.
The best advice we can give is that we should always take the most appropriate programming language to your needs.
And the one you prefer use.
