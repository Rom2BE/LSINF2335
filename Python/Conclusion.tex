\section{Conclusion}

As explained before, Python is a perfect language to easily build various type of applications. 
Reflection seems to be omnipresent in this language. 
It is completely integrated in the way of programming in Python.
Using reflection is done naturally and most of the people do it without even knowing the concept of reflection. 
This is for us the proof that reflection is successfully and fully integrated in Python.

ADD CONCLUSION ABOUT VERSUS WITH OTHER LANGUAGES\\
o	What can other (reflective) languages learn from this language?\\
o	What can this language learn from how reflection is dealt with in other languages?\\
