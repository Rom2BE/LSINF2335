\section{Reflection and meta-programming}
\subsection{Reflective features}
•	What language features for dealing with reflection and meta-programming does the chosen language provide?\\
•	What kinds of reflection and meta-programming features does that language offer?\\
•	What is the MOP (meta-object protocol) for that language?\\
•	What are the limitations of the reflective features provided by this language?\\
•	Illustrate your explanations with working code fragments.\\

\subsection{Applications of reflection}
•	What are the typical applications that reflection could be used for in this language?\\
•	Can you give a working code example of such a typical problem that requires a reflective solution?\\
•	Does there exist a “killer-app” for this language that has been implemented with reflection?\\

\subsection{Comparison with other languages}
•	How does this language compare to Smalltalk, Java or Ruby from the point of view of the reflective features it supports, the kinds of reflection it offers, or its MOP?\\
•	What can this language learn from those languages?\\
•	Does it offer some specific reflective features that you do not have in either Smalltalk, Ruby or Java? (Can Smalltalk/Java learn something from reflection in this language?)\\
•	Does it offer some powerful native (non-reflective) features that allow you to express things for which you would need reflection in other languages (like Smalltalk, Ruby or Java)?\\
